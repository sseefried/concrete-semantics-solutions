# Solutions

In this file I explain where the solutions to various exercises can be found.
Normally I try to keep a solution self-contained in a single file with
a naming convention like `Exercise<m>p<n>.thy` which corresponds to exercise
`m.n`.

However, some exercises required making modifications to previous files.
In this case I will signal here which files correspond to each exercises.

`A.thy -> B.thy` means that theory `A` depends on theory `B`.


# Exercise 7.8

Com_7p8.thy
Big_step_7p8.thy   -> Com_7p8.thy
Small_step_7p8.thy -> Com_7p8.thy
